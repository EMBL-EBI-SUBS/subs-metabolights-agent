Arabidopsis thaliana cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double knockout plants are completely impaired in the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime and do not accumulate IAOx-derived metabolites any longer. Consequently, comparative analysis of wild-type and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plant lines has the potential to explore the complete range of IAOx-derived indolic secondary metabolites.",

Plants were sprayed with an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (5 mM) in order to stimulate accumulation of indolic secondary metabolites and incubated for 48 h in a growth cabinet under the same conditions as described above. Rosette leaves of six individual plants per genotype were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, pooled and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Two independent experiments (biological replicates) were performed on independent sets of plants grown at different times.",

      "description": "Differential features detected in narrow retention time windows displaying a high chromatogram correlation were grouped. In combination with the raw data, individual compound mass spectra were reconstructed and features annotated as cluster ion, quasimolecular ion, or in-source fragment ion. Annotated lists of all differential feature sets are provided in Supplemental DataSet S5 of DOI: 10.1007/s11306-012-0401-0 online. Afterwards, targeted CID-MS/MS experiments of quasimolecular ions (MS2) were performed using QTOF-MS. Based on accurate mass measurements, putative elemental compositions were calculated, filtered by isotope abundance and the number of double bond equivalents and electron parity [1], and checked for consistency in relation to elemental compositions calculated for fragment ions and observed neutral losses [2]. Mass spectral characterization of CID mass spectra can be found in Supplemental Data Set S6 (DOI: 10.1007/s11306-012-0401-0) online. Identification was based on reference spectra in MassBank (MSI Level 2 and 3), and in some cases on authentic standards (MSI Level 1).\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Kind, T., & Fiehn, O. (2006).
